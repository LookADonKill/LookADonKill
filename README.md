      <td valign="text-top">Determined Path is a Serious Game, telling a story about Andi's journey as a bus driver. Enjoy each and every moments within the game as you drove through the city and don't forget to keep your eyes peeled for the exquisite landmarks!</td>
     <td valign="text-top">5 Years From Now, an idea. For the time being, the game had stopped growing. Though, don't count us out yet. Like those plants within, it will soon bloomed over and sprouted the skies with Oxygen!</td>
     <td valign="text-top">Mario Judah is a 2D platformer game, another take of another well known famous video game franchise. It was a game that followed Mario Judah's escape from his own nightmare, lurking from behind and closing in. Watch your steps and make sure to reach the end!</td>
     <td valign="text-top">Rupture is a shooter game where it's only you against the hordes of beasts. Rupture followed a man who trapped in a land with nowhere to run. He glanced ahead, noticing the enemy sudden appearance. They were fierce and murderous. Survive the horde and live to tell the tale!</td>
